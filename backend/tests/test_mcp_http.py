"""Tests for the MCP Streamable HTTP transport + per-session state (Phase 5).

Covers:
  * 5b — each MCP session gets its own ProjectState (no cross-session bleed),
    while the stdio shared-state path keeps one instance.
  * 5c — the HTTP endpoint requires a valid bearer token when auth is enabled,
    and is open (no 401) when auth is disabled.

The per-session tests use the SDK's in-memory client/server transport so a real
ServerSession is created per connection — no network, no database (the tools we
call resolve against empty state).
